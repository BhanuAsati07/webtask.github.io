                <h2>Message of Chairman</h2>

                <p><i>As a chairman of Shri Guru Nanak Education Society, I feel very delighted to see the
                        small seedling sown in the year - 1990 with the promise to light the lamp of knowledge
                        through education now it has become a fruitful tree. We at Shri Gurunanak Sr. Sec. School
                        strive to offer much more then more education. We lay immense emphasis on the overall
                        development
                        of every child through physical. Mental and spiritual training in an attempt, to make these
                        young minds grow up,not just into fine educated gentlemen but men who have the powers to make a
                        difference,
                        so that today's prodigies grow up to become tomorrow's leaders. </i></p> <br>
